			<h1 class="pinkText">Bloom</h1>
			<p><span class="pinkText">Bloom</span> was a text-based role-playing game developed as a passion project.</p>
			<p>The game was played through a Discord bot, the code itself written using the help of the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">discord.py</a> API wrapper. A player would send commands through the respective text channels or add reactions to the bot's returned messages to view their inventory, find and attack monsters, and travel the world map.</p>

					<p>A player must be registered with one of the five character classes to run commands.</p>
					<p>Each class has access to seven unique flower moves, which deal nonphysical damage, cost <span class="cmdText">FP</span> (Flower Points, a kind of mana) to use, and are acquired as the player levels up.</p>
					<p>Every class also varies in the scaling of their stats as they level up, as indicated by the number of stars.</p>

					<p>You can equip some number of weapons, up to two rings, and one neckpiece item to customize your character.</p>
					<p>Primarily, weapons affect the damage you deal with your physical attack and rings apply a small buff to your stats.</p>
					<p>Every neckpiece has a unique effect that activates during battle.</p>

					<p>The advantages of flower moves vary between classes.</p><p>While the occultist and dragoon are designed to overpower enemies with powerful magic attacks, the gardener and alchemist enjoy more vast elemental support.</p><p>On the other hand, the gunslinger is lacking in magical capabilities.</p>

					<p>Once a player registers with a class, they can open the world map, allowing them to move to nearby map tiles one at a time.</p>
					<p>Some map tiles contain shops, inns, and other features, but monsters may be encountered at every instance they move.</p>

					<p>Defeating monsters rewards you with bolts, the game's primary currency.</p>

					<p>Alternatively, some flower moves will not deal damage at all, instead providing some sort of buff to you or some of your allies.</p>
