			<h1 class="bloomText">Bloom</h1>
			<p><span class="bloomText">Bloom</span> was a text-based role-playing game developed as a passion project.</p>
			<p>The game was played through a <span class="discordText">Discord</span> bot, the code itself written using the help of the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">discord.py</a> API wrapper. A player would send commands through the respective text channels or add reactions to the bot's returned messages to view their inventory, find and attack monsters, and travel the world map.</p>

					<p>A player must be registered with one of the five character classes to run commands.</p>
					<p>Each class has access to seven unique <span class="redText">flower moves</span>, which deal nonphysical damage, cost <span class="cmdText">FP</span> (Flower Points, a kind of mana) to use, and are acquired as the player levels up.</p>
					<p>Every class also varies in the scaling of their stats as they level up, as indicated by the number of stars.</p>

					<p>You can equip some number of weapons, up to two rings, and one neckpiece to customize your character.</p>
					<p>Primarily, <span class="orangeText">weapons</span> affect the damage you deal with your physical attack and <span class="blueText">rings</span> apply a small buff to your stats.</p>

					<p>On the other hand, the <span class="orangeText">gunslinger</span> is lacking in magical capabilities, relying almost entirely on physical attacks.</p>
